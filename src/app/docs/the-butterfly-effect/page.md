Jarvis AI is a powerful tool that uses vector data stores to help you find reference files. This feature allows you to create amazing prompts that can be used to generate websites, code, and documents.

## Understanding Vector Data Stores

Vector data stores are a type of database designed for storing vector data. They are highly efficient and provide fast access to stored data. Jarvis AI uses these data stores to quickly find and retrieve reference files.

### How Jarvis AI Uses Vector Data Stores

Jarvis AI uses vector data stores to quickly find and retrieve reference files. These files can be used as a basis for creating prompts that generate websites, code, and documents. The speed and efficiency of vector data stores make them an ideal choice for this task.

```js
/** @type {import('@jarvisai/jarvis').referenceFiles} */
export default {
  referenceFiles: 'vectorDataStores',
  useCase: ['websites', 'code', 'documents'],
  benefits: {
    speed: true,
    efficiency: true,
  },
}
```

The above code snippet is an example of how Jarvis AI might use vector data stores to handle reference files.

### The Benefits of Using Jarvis AI

With Jarvis AI, you can quickly and easily find reference files using vector data stores. This allows you to create amazing prompts that can be used to generate websites, code, and documents. The speed and efficiency of Jarvis AI make it an ideal tool for this task.
