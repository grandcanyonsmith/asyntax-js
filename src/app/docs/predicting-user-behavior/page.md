Prompt engineering is a complex and challenging field. It involves creating prompts that can effectively guide AI models to produce desired outputs. However, it is not without its problems. 

## The Challenges of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is often a trial-and-error process. It requires a deep understanding of the model's behavior and the ability to anticipate how it will respond to different prompts. This can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when the model's responses are unpredictable or inconsistent.

### The Future of Prompt Engineering

As AI models continue to advance, the role of prompt engineering is likely to change. Instead of manually crafting prompts, we may see more automated processes, such as algorithms that can generate effective prompts based on the model's past behavior.

```js
/** @type {import('@tailwindlabs/lorem').ipsum} */
export default {
  lorem: 'ipsum',
  dolor: ['sit', 'amet', 'consectetur'],
  adipiscing: {
    elit: true,
  },
}
```

However, this doesn't mean that prompt engineering will become obsolete. Instead, it will evolve into a new form. The question will no longer be "how can I craft the perfect prompt?" but rather "how can I quickly gather information from multiple sources into one prompt to get my desired output as quickly as possible?"

### The Evolution of Prompt Engineering

This shift will require new skills and approaches. Prompt engineers will need to become adept at integrating diverse data sources and using advanced algorithms to process and analyze this data. They will also need to stay abreast of the latest developments in AI and machine learning, as these will directly impact their work.

In conclusion, while prompt engineering is currently a challenging field, it holds great promise for the future. As AI models become more sophisticated, prompt engineering will play a crucial role in harnessing their full potential.

For example, consider a prompt from 2018: "Make me a Python script that will print hello world". Now, compare this with a potential prompt from 2024: "Generate a Python script that will send my manager a message on slack and respond to his message asking what Kelly said in the email she sent me last week. Use my gmail api key, and my slack api key." This latter prompt requires several different sources of information, including the user's slack api key, their gmail api key, and an organizational chart to determine the identities of the manager and Kelly.
